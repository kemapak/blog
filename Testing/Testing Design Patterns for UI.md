# Testing Design Patterns for UI

> _"It is better not to have any tests than having unreliable tests."_

So here I am trying to advocate writing good tests and asking you not to write tests just for the sake writing tests. The question is does tests improves quality of our code? The answer in my opinion is only good tests result in good code. Bad tests will only give you a false and very dangerous confidence with nice code coverage report.
