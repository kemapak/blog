# Unit Tests

"Having dirty tests is equivalent to, if not worse than, having no tests." - Robert Martin [1](#cite01)

Actually in my opinion it is better to have no tests then bad tests. What a way to start promoting tests by saying
do not write tests if you are not going to really do it properly. May be shocking but this is the truth.

Wrong tests will give you false confidence or false concern. You will never know if your code is running as expected or 
not.

**Test code is real code, it must be clean and simple!**

If you do not write your test properly, maintaining them could become a huge task by itself.

> Unit tests are not written to catch bugs but prevent them. It is very different from end to end, 
> functional tests which are written to catch bugs.
