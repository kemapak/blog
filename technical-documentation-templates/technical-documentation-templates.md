# Technical documentation templates

Writing a technical documentation sometimes feels like pulling a tooth. Where to start what to write can be a daunting
task. Below document templates hopefully help you to start. Please remember they are just here as a guidance you can 
customize (and should) for your specific needs to your company's standards.

- [Application documentation template](./templates/application-documentation-template.md) This is per application or a new functionality within an application. Usually 
suited for engineering leads.

- [Architectural investigation template]() This is for web architects to document their technical investigations, 
spikes and prototypes.

- [Architectural solution template]() This is for web architects to document their solutions, proposals related to a 
new application, design or system.
