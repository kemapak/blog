# Text Spacing Bookmarklet
Testing text spacing is an important requirement for web accessibility (a11y). You can use a helpful bookmarklet 
created by **Dylan Barrell** to quickly verify spacing compliance.

## Chrome Setup
1. Visit the [bookmarklet page](https://dylanb.github.io/bookmarklets.html)
2. Drag the **Text Spacing link** from the page into your bookmarks bar.
   - Alternatively, you can manually create a bookmark and paste the bookmarklet link.
