# Accessibility a short introduction

What is accessibility? why it is important? As an engineer you might have been asked to make sure you build your 
application accessible. How can you do that? This document will get you started and give you some tips, show you some 
examples.
> Note: This document only covers web accessibility.

First, I have to say accessibility is not a requirement it is a moral obligation. As a professional engineer, as a 
craftsman you have to build an application properly functioning, bug free and accessible.

Second, I hate politics being brought into accessibility. It is not inclusive design or engineering, it is accessible 
design and engineering. No one is intentionally is excluding anyone. We are building software for everyone! Because 
this is the right thing to do, because we are professionals.

# Rule 01 -Use semantic tags
I do see that most of the engineers do not know how to build proper markup. Even in some famous frameworks, design 
libraries are build incorrectly. `<div>` tags are used everywhere, anywhere without thinking.
